## About Me

I am a research engineer in the **XR-Tech 3D GenAI** team at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/). Prior to joining Meta, I was a research engineer in the Intelligent Creation Lab at [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) / [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/about?lang=en) based in San Jose, CA, USA. Prior to that, I was a computer vision engineer at [Matterport](https://matterport.com/discover) working on large scale high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and indoor touring. I graduated with my Ph.D. degree from [Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Dallas](https://cs.utdallas.edu/), under supervision of Prof. [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/). Before that, I graduated with my master degree in computer science from [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under supervision of Prof. [Yu-shen Liu](https://yushen-liu.github.io/) and Prof. [Jun-hai Yong](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/junhaiyong.htm), and my bachelor degree from [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/), both at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My current research interests are mainly in 3D GenAI area now, specifically on 3D model and animation generation. Previously I was focused on talking head generation, human video generation, multi-modal motion synthesis and generative modeling.
