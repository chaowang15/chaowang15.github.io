# Plan — Hacker News Daily Scraper

> How to use this file: this is a **single living document**, edited in
> place — never date-versioned. When an item here is finished: if it was a
> durable decision, summarize it into `docs/DECISIONS.md`; the detailed
> narrative goes in `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Once captured elsewhere, remove
> the item from this file instead of leaving it to accumulate. This file
> should always read as "what's true right now," not a history.

## Current status

Production and stable. Two GitHub Actions workflows run on schedule:
`hn_top.yml` (twice daily) and `hn_weekly.yml` (weekly). The former daily
`hn_best.yml` workflow was retired on 2026-10-31; historical Best pages are
preserved. As of 2026-09-11: 204+ days of data, 30,000+ stories archived
under `hackernews/`.

## Current goal

Reduce recurring LLM cost while improving bilingual summary fidelity. Top runs
twice daily, GPT tag classification is incremental, and new summaries use a
strictly bounded source excerpt: 2–3 factual sentences followed by at most one
source-supported significance sentence. New summaries use `gpt-5.6-luna`;
tagging remains on `gpt-5-nano` so the quality/cost change stays isolated.

## In progress

Nothing.

## Next steps

None currently planned. Candidate ideas mentioned in old notes
(`logs/archive/analysis_report.md`, `logs/archive/analysis_notes.md`) that
were never scheduled:
- Tag-based filtering UI on the index/search page (tags are already stored
  per-item; only the UI is missing).
- `onerror` fallback for external preview images (currently relies on CSS
  placeholder + lazy loading only).
- Search index growth is unbounded (grows ~100 items/day); no sharding plan
  exists yet.

## Known issues

- **`logs/openai_token_usage_log.md` is git-tracked and append-only.** It
  already has 10k+ lines. It is not currently rotated/archived — if this
  becomes a real problem, decide a rotation scheme (e.g. yearly file) and
  update `token_logger.py` + the two workflows' Job Summary `tail` commands
  together, since they hardcode this filename.
- **External preview images depend entirely on third-party sites staying
  up** — no local caching, no error fallback in the rendered HTML.

## Open questions

None currently.
